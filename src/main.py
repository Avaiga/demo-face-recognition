# Face **recognition**{: .color-primary}

This demo shows how to use [Taipy](https://taipy.io/) with a [custom GUI component](https://docs.taipy.io/en/latest/manuals/gui/extension/) to capture video from your webcam and do realtime face detection. What this application demonstrates:

- How to build a complex custom UI component for Taipy.

- How to detect and recognize faces in the image in real time using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).


Wait for your face to be detected. Then, capture your face, provide your name, and retrain the model.
