# Demo Face Recognition

## What is Demo Face Recognition

This demo shows how to use Taipy with a custom GUI component to capture video from your webcam and do realtime face detection.

What this application demonstrates:
* How to build a complex custom UI component for Taipy.
* How to detect and recognize faces in the image in real time using OpenCV.


## Demo Type

- **Level**: Advanced
- **Topic**: Taipy-GUI, Computer Vision
- **Components/Controls**:
  - Taipy GUI: custom GUI component
- **Other**: OpenCV
